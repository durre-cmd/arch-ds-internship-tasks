# Titanic Survival Classification

**Task:** Predict survival of Titanic passengers using machine learning.

**Description:**  
This task is part of the Arch Technologies Data Science Internship.  
The goal is to clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

**Files:**  
- `titanic_classification.py` – Python script with full implementation.

**How to Run:**  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

Run the script:

python titanic_classification.py

Model:

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Note:

The script uses Seaborn's built-in Titanic dataset.

Optional: Displays feature importance plot.
